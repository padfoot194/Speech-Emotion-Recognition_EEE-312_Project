# Speech-Emotion-Recognition_EEE-312_Project
Hello, this is Mushfiqul Amin (Student ID: 2106194), an undergraduate student of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I along with my mates Md. Ahsanul Karim (Student ID: 2106172), Ratul Das (Student ID: 2106176) and Saumik Banik (Student ID: 2106179) have done this project for our undergraduate lab; Digital Signal Processing-1 Laboratory. This project details a speech emotion recognition system using machine learning to classify emotions in English and Bangla audio datasets, including RAVDESS and a custom BanglaSER dataset. It employs features like MFCC, chromagram, Mel-spectrogram, spectral roll-off, and centroid, enhanced with Teager Energy Operator and higher-order statistics, achieving accuracies up to 78.24% for Bangla (KNN, k=1) and 58% for English (KNN, k=1). The project compares four models—KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVC—highlighting KNN's superior performance, and aims to address applications like threat detection and psychological evaluation. Future work plans to incorporate neural networks for improved accuracy as using Neural network is out of the scope of our laboratory outcomes.

This Github repository consists all the codes, the dataset link and the demonstration video link. Feel free to explore. ^_^
